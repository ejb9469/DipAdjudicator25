#1. Implement Coasts + relevant Test Cases
#2. Implement Retreats & Builds phases (remember `Retreats.suffocated(...)`!)
#3. Implement `Referee.java` class that handles dislodgement and tactical results of moves based on context
#4. Implement `Game.java` class that has one Referee and 1+ Judge(s)
        --> `Board.java` needed? or superfluous?
        --> Placement of `TestCaseManager.java` ??
#5. Implement `GameMaster.java` class that controls the flow of the game -- e.g. `GameCondition.java` enum
#6. Implement in-dev entry point to play boards


~ Read & parse all "to-dos"

~ Province name aliases -- e.g. "Heligoland Bight" vs. "Helgoland Bight"
~ Add more metadata to Enums (e.g. toString() functions)

~ Allow comments in test case files
