    ~ JDocs and comments for new code (e.g. Referee, RetreatsJudge, PiecePusher, Constants, misc. new functions, etc.)
    ~ Rename / refactor names of new code (especially first 3 classes in above examples)
    // [DONE] --> ~ Reorganize most constants into `Constants.java`, and create more constants if any opportunities
    ~ Complete implementation of the 'Retreats Flow', utilizing `PiecePusher.java`
    ~ Implement Builds Flow, utilizing `PiecePusher.java` (??)
    ~ Create special `TestCase.java` subclass that handles Test Cases re: Retreats information
    ~ DITTO, "...Test Cases re: Builds information"
    ~ Research the nature of `Referee::judge()` outcomes -- e.g. locate interesting test cases.
        ~ Is there any (semi-)universal rule to choose between different possible resolutions?
    ~ Design and draft 'Paradox Detection'
        ~ Ignore [P=1] (??)

    ~ Implement Paradox Detection
    ~ Improve algorithmic & memory allocation efficiency of `Referee.java` methods (re: permutations, etc.)
    ~ Add new aliases / improve aliases system in `Province.java`


::10-08-25::
#1. Implement Coasts + relevant Test Cases
#2. Implement Retreats & Builds phases (remember `Retreats.suffocated(...)`!)
#3. Implement `Referee.java` class that handles dislodgement and tactical results of moves based on context
#4. Implement `Game.java` class that has one Referee and 1+ Judge(s)
        --> `Board.java` needed? or superfluous?
        --> Placement of `TestCaseManager.java` ??
#5. Implement `GameMaster.java` class that controls the flow of the game -- e.g. `GameCondition.java` enum
#6. Implement in-dev entry point to play boards


~ Read & parse all "to-dos"

~ Province name aliases -- e.g. "Heligoland Bight" vs. "Helgoland Bight"
~ Add more metadata to Enums (e.g. toString() functions)

~ Allow comments in test case files
