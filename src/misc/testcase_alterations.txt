6.A.10. SUPPORT ON UNREACHABLE DESTINATION NOT POSSIBLE ::
    ~ Technically, the support order should fail due to its invalidity, but the program calls it successful.
    ~ It still does not count the support in any way, so I will leave the interpretation of this Test Case up to a higher level

6.D.28. IMPOSSIBLE MOVE AND SUPPORT ::
    ~ According to the DATC issue 4.E.1 (https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.E.1), all invalid orders (incl. moves) should be interpreted as holds, ...
      ... and thus should be able to receive hold support.
    ~ Many sites (such as Backstabbr) do not respect this rule afaik, and it makes most sense to me to 'void' the order (i.e. it cannot receive support), ...
      ... rather than 'allowing' it to hold. (In the base `Judge` class)
    ~ However, the `StrictJudge` subclass should follow the DATC interpretation -- i.e. set all invalid orders to holds


6.D.31. A TRICKY IMPOSSIBLE SUPPORT ::
    ~ According to the DATC issue 4.E.1 (https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.E.1), the move "F BLA S Rum - Arm" should be prejudged as illegal, ...
      ... because the only way the move "A Rum - Arm" succeeds is via convoy, and "F BLA" is the only possible convoy route
    ~ This sort of optimization seems unnecessary, and more importantly it may introduce more problems than it solves. So I am leaving it out.
    ~ The DATC Test Case 6.D.31 snippet states that this is relevant for computer programs that show only legal moves...
      ... This seems like the sort of functionality best left to an upper level, or `StrictJudge`.

6.D.32. A MISSING FLEET ::
    ~ Idem. (https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.E.1)
