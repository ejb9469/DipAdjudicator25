6.A.10. SUPPORT ON UNREACHABLE DESTINATION NOT POSSIBLE ::
    ~ Technically, the support order should fail due to its invalidity, but the program calls it successful.
    ~ It still does not count the support, so I will leave the interpretation of this Test Case up to a higher level (ATM)


6.B.02. MOVING WITH UNSPECIFIED COAST WHEN COAST IS NOT NECESSARY ::
    ~ The DATC indicates this as a matter of preference, and this adjudicator works better by ruling the other way; simply pretending squares like...
        ... Spa, Bul, and Stp are inland provinces, with 2+ coast tentacles attached. It's spaghetti... but sometimes you shouldn't question the pasta


6.B.07. SUPPORTING OWN UNIT WITH UNSPECIFIED COAST ::
    ~ The DATC indicates this as a matter of preference, and this adjudicator works better by ruling the other way: ...
        ... "F Por S (F) MAO - Spa" will immediately fail (-> false) b/c it does not have a corresponding order.
        ... What "should" be the corresponding order specifies "Spa/nc", which is a mismatch
    ~ It should be noted that if the French moves are changed to *both* specify "Spa" (no coast), the support will not fail, ...
        ... but the Move will, (presumably) because it (a fleet) is attempting to navigate to an "inland" province (Spa).


6.B.08. SUPPORTING WITH UNSPECIFIED COAST WHEN ONLY ONE COAST IS POSSIBLE ::
    ~ The DATC indicates the French support should be followed despite its ambiguity, because it is a "poorly written order".
    ~ The DATC has elsewhere indicated matters of order writing judgement are a matter of preference. I will rule the other way.


6.D.28. IMPOSSIBLE MOVE AND SUPPORT ::
    ~ According to the DATC issue 4.E.1 (https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.E.1), all invalid orders (incl. moves) should be interpreted as holds, ...
        ... and thus should be able to receive hold support.
    ~ Many sites (such as Backstabbr) do not respect this rule afaik, and it makes most sense to me to 'void' the order (i.e. it cannot receive support), ...
        ... rather than 'allowing' it to hold. (In the base `Judge` class)
    ~ However, the `StrictJudge` subclass should follow the DATC interpretation -- i.e. set all invalid orders to holds


6.D.29. MOVE TO IMPOSSIBLE COAST AND SUPPORT ::
    ~ Idem. (https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.E.1)


6.D.30. MOVE WITHOUT COAST AND SUPPORT ::
    ~ Idem. (https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.E.1)
    ~ Note: The Russian move "F Con - Bul" (afaik) fails b/c `Province.Bul` (no coast) is labeled as `Geography.INLAND`


6.D.31. A TRICKY IMPOSSIBLE SUPPORT ::
    ~ According to the DATC issue 4.E.1 (https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.E.1), the move "F BLA S Rum - Arm" should be prejudged as illegal, ...
      ... because the only way the move "A Rum - Arm" succeeds is via convoy, and "F BLA" is the only possible convoy route
    ~ This sort of optimization seems unnecessary, and more importantly it may introduce more problems than it solves. So I am leaving it out.
    ~ The DATC Test Case 6.D.31 snippet states that this is relevant for computer programs that show only legal moves...
        ... This seems like the sort of functionality best left to an upper level, or `StrictJudge`.


6.D.32. A MISSING FLEET ::
    ~ Idem. (https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.E.1)


6.FF.24. SECOND ORDER PARADOX WITH NO RESOLUTION ::
    ~ This Test Case has "no resolution", and I argue that my alternative (F Lon's support is cut because F ENG is not dislodged, therefore F NTH holds succeeds)...
      ... conforms better to the Szykman Alternative, because F ENG is not really a problem convoy.


6.G.02. KIDNAPPING AN ARMY ::
    ~ Both DATC and the official rulebook are against me on this one; they both rule that 'Convoy Kidnapping' should not be allowed as such, ...
      ... and that, for the convoy to succeed, EITHER the army + fleet must be of the same nationality, OR the army has specified "via convoy".
    ~ (See: https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.A.3)
    ~ However, I have decided to allow Convoy Kidnapping for 3 reasons:
        1) the "via convoy" feature will be implemented in a future subclass of `Judge`, perhaps `StrictJudge`
        2) Without the presence of "via convoy" (as in: this implementation), I would argue that Convoy Kidnapping should be allowed
        3) Backstabbr, the premier platform for the online Diplomacy hobby (as of writing 10-15-25), allows for Convoy Kidnapping


6.G.07. SWAPPING WITH ILLEGAL INTENT ::
        +(and)+
6.G.14. BOUNCE BY CONVOY TO ADJACENT PROVINCE ::
        +(and)+
6.G.15. BOUNCE AND DISLODGE WITH DOUBLE CONVOY ::
    ~ DATC indicates that "F BOT C Swe - Nwy" (no other convoys) should be deemed illegal...
    ~ But so long as it doesn't cause problems later, this adjudicator functions better by assuming it is legal (there could, theoretically, be other fleets in a chain that make this work)
    ~ I suppose, since there is no possible Convoy Route from Swe -> Nwy over the Baltic-region tiles, one could implicitly deem this order illegal.
    ~ But I have not implemented implicit invalidity like that in similar instances, so I will leave this alone...
      ... (see 6.D.31. A TRICKY IMPOSSIBLE SUPPORT)


6.G.8. EXPLICIT CONVOY THAT ISN'T THERE ::
    ~ Not applicable without the "via convoy" explicit convoy intention signal feature. Says as much on the DATC page.
    ~ So, I left this one out of the Test Case suite for `Judge`.


6.G.10. SWAPPED OR AN HEAD-TO-HEAD BATTLE(qm) ::
    ~ DATC indicates there are 2 possible interpretations (https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.A.7)
    ~ It goes with Interpretation B (DATC). I am going with interpretation A (rulebook), since it is what this adjudicator prefers, ...
      ... and because Interpr. B mentions convoy swaps as "special exceptions to other rules", which contradicts the philosophy (thus far) of Base Class `Judge.java`


6.G.11.P. A CONVOY TO AN ADJACENT PROVINCE WITH A PARADOX ::
    ~ Fallback is allowed in base-class `Judge`, so I went with the 1973 rulebook adjudication. It seems more akin to this adjudicator's principles.
    ~ See:
        1) https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.A.2
        2) https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.A.3


6.G.13. SUPPORT CUT ON ATTACK ON ITSELF VIA CONVOY ::
    ~ Using the 1971 rulebook adjudication. It seems more akin to this adjudicator's (`Judge`) principles
    ~ See: (https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.A.3)


6.G.19. SWAPPING WITH INTENT OF UNNECESSARY CONVOY ::
    ~ Following the precedent of our 70s-era liberal convoy-swapping policy, I will follow the 1971 rulebook here and swap the units.
    ~ See:
        1) https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.A.3
        2) https://webdiplomacy.net/doc/DATC_v3_0.html#4.E.1


6.G.20. EXPLICIT CONVOY TO ADJACENT PROVINCE DISRUPTED ::
    ~ Fallback is allowed in base-class `Judge`, without the notion of "via convoy". This Test Case reflects that.
