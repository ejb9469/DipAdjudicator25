~ Read & parse all to-dos

~ Allow comments in test case files

~ Update `Province` enum to modern standards
~ Implement split coast rules -- e.g. 'Bul/sc' & 'Bul/ec' are sub-Provinces of base 'Bul'
~ Implement normal coast rules -- e.g. 'Tus' and 'Ven' are both coastal, and they border by land, but not by sea
    - We may have to split the handling of armies & fleets in `pathSuccessful(...)` -- e.g. "F Tus - Ven" is illegal but "A Tus - Ven" is not

~ Province name aliases -- e.g. "Heligoland Bight" vs. "Helgoland Bight"
