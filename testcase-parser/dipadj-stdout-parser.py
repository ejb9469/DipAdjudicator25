# This script will compare the stdout of a bunch of runs of DipAdj25,
# ... using the random-ordered-orders TestCases option.
# Then it will approximate the "success rate" of each TestCase

# Anything lower than 100% is inadequate, unless for whatever reason this only happens with certain paradoxes that can be accounted for.
